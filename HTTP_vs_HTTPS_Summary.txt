HTTP and HTTPS - Summary

HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the way web browsers and websites talk to each other. But it's not safe because anyone watching the network can read the messages.

HTTPS (HTTP Secure) is like HTTP, but it adds a lock using something called SSL/TLS encryption. This keeps the data private and protected, so no one else can read or change it. Websites that deal with personal or sensitive information — like banks or email services — always use HTTPS to keep users safe.

Structure of an HTTP Request and Response

HTTP Request (What the browser sends to the website):
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
User-Agent: Chrome
Accept: text/html

HTTP Response (What the website sends back):
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 1256

Common HTTP Methods and What They Do

GET     - Get data from the server        (e.g. viewing a webpage)
POST    - Send data to the server         (e.g. submitting a form)
PUT     - Update data on the server       (e.g. editing your profile)
DELETE  - Delete data on the server       (e.g. deleting a comment)

Common HTTP Status Codes and What They Mean
